# CS-2413-Projects
This is the repository for my CS 2413 (Data Structures) Projects

This course involved five projects, and I will have them posted here, as well as some descriptions about the projects, what my goals were, and other various information statements.

A point I forgot to expand upon in Project Three was that there were the following operations conducted upon NovelQueue: Add (Enqueue) – 'A', Remove (Dequeue) – 'R', Modify – 'M', Change Job Values – 'C', Promote - 'P', Reorder Based on Attributes – 'O', Display – 'D', Count – 'N', List Jobs – 'L'.
